## Problem

Besides being a Haskeller, Jon Snow is also a huge fan of Reddit. It is no
wonder that he reads the haskell subreddit (/r/haskell) frequently. However,
both Chrome and Firefox on his computer was hijacked by the Lannisters. IE is
fine but he doesn't know that it exists 
([http://media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/e8/ef/92/e8ef922fff4171bf91fa36180c7490cf.jpg](indeed, Jon Snow doesn't know much)) so
he has hired you to write a tool to display to current hot posts in /r/haskell.
