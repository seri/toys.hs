## Problem

Due to the massive movement toward self-publishing and open source book writing
in the technical books market, O'Reily is forced to reposition itself in the
classic fictions market. Jon Snow was hired by O'Reily to spell check its first
release, the nth edition of Pride of Prejudice. Jon figured there would be a
lot of jobs like this coming so he hired you to write a spell checking software
once and for all. He also demanded it to be as fast as possible.
