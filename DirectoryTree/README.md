## Problem

Jon Snow is a Haskeller but there were no jobs for Haskellers in Winterfell.
Actually, there were no jobs for Haskellers anywhere in Westeros. He eventually
managed to get a job at King's Landing involving Java. His first assignment is
to maintain a legacy Java code base. Jon likes to `cd` around to navigate a new
code base but this is a bit unpleasant to do with 
`src/java/main/org/enterprise/foo/bar` so he hired you to write a tool to
display the whole source tree all at once.
